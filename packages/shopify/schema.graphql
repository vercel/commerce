To format currencies, combine this type's amount and currencyCode fields with your client's locale.

For example, in JavaScript you could use Intl.NumberFormat:

```js
new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, {
  style: 'currency',
  currency: currencyCode
}).format(amount);
```

Other formatting libraries include:

* iOS - [NumberFormatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter)
* Android - [NumberFormat](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/text/NumberFormat.html)
* PHP - [NumberFormatter](http://php.net/manual/en/class.numberformatter.php)

For a more general solution, the [Unicode CLDR number formatting database] is available with many implementations
(such as [TwitterCldr](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-cldr-rb)).
