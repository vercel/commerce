An order is a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a shop. You can retrieve and update orders using the Order object.
Learn more about [editing an existing order with the Admin API](https://shopify.dev/api/examples/order-editing).

Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the `Order` object by default. If you want to access older orders,
then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/oauth#orders-permissions). If your app is granted
access, then you can add the `read_all_orders` scope to your app along with `read_orders` or `write_orders`.
[Private apps](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/basic-http) are not affected by this change and are automatically granted the scope.

**Caution:** Only use this data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/access-scopes) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.
