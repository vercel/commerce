The water originates from a spring near the watershed of the Shinano River and Kiso River, and is characterized by its clarity and smooth, rounded texture brought about by a rare “water hardness” of less than 25."

Most sake breweries use large tanks (3,000L to 8,000L) suitable for mass production, often dividing tasks across a large team. At our brewery, we have scaled down to smaller tanks (900L to 1,800L) so that our single master brewer can meticulously and efficiently manage every step of the brewing process – enabling us to produce high-quality sake through small-lot production. While sake is typically produced in the winter, we have incorporated a year-round production method called “shiki-jozo,” or “four-seasons brewing,” so that we can reflect the changing seasons and beautiful nature of Nagano in our sake."

Yet the concept of “A Colorful Black” is not about one single color, but rather a mixture of colors, meticulously layered together one paint at a time. For each batch of narai, I imagine myself harmonizing the various elements of the sake’s flavor – richness and fullness, dryness and sweetness, aroma – carefully adjusting each element according to the conditions of the mountain water and rice of that particular batch. A sake that is well-balanced, yet feels like a burst of colors as it spreads across your palate… this is the kind of sake I hope to create. We hope you enjoy narai – “water of the mountains, sake of the skies” – a sake that expresses the beautiful nature of Nagano.",

At 30, also recognizing the importance of branding in the realm of sake, Irie moved to Matsumoto Sake Brewery in Kyoto where he worked under master brewer Hidehiko Matsumoto for 5 years. Building on these experiences, Irie came to suginomori brewery as master brewer, with a goal to create a unique sake from his own vision."
